i dont want to pass 100 args in the func brackets 


see i'm in an MxN problem, there are printers and labels - lets say 3 of both of them which means I have to write 9 fns, which will differ only for some values like position of barcode, sap & sub sap and description. 
Currently I am doing like when the user selects the printer name and label size then on pressing the print button, it will call a fn which will check for which printer user selected by checking the presence of a string eg GT800 for Zebra GT800 EPL Printer, ZD421 for Zebra ZD421 ZPL Printer and the label size like "if "Medium" in label_size:" with this the program will call (eg)

zd421_medium_zpl_printer( # see function docstring for arg explanation
                    z,
                    asset_val,
                    sub_asset_val,
                    barcode=full_code,
                    description=description,
                    printer_name=printer,
                    print_count=print_count
                    )

this func call reaches the thing i given previosuly, for which i wrote boilerplate code like 
                      gt800_epl_printer,  
                      gt800_medium_epl_printer, 
                      zd421_zpl_printer, 
                      zd421_medium_zpl_printer, 
                      zd230_zpl_big_label_printer, 
                      zd230_zpl_small_label_printer
which i know inefficent and not-scalable but to make the sys work i done this, but everyday 1 or 2 days people are coming up with newer printer models or label sizes, which makes my code more boilerplate, tangled and messy. I need a rescue. If you want any more details ask me.


give me a high level overview on my explanation and your proposed solution.

my code has a streamlit interface where the user selects a printer from a dropdown and then selects a label size which will be listed as radio buttons. this two determines which printer and label to choose so that my code selects the correct fn by that they will get the correctly aligned prints. 

My goal is to make the interface so minimalist that anyone can directly and freely use it. If i can redesign it in any other way I am ready to change.
