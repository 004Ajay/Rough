If you use pyinstaller to package your Python script into a standalone executable, it can be a bit more difficult to push updates to users.
One way to accomplish this would be to have the application check for updates on startup, or at regular intervals,
and prompt the user to download the updated executable if one is available.

Here is an example of how you can check for updates and prompt the user to download the new version:
"""

import requests
import json
import os

# URL of the version file that contains the current version of the app
version_url = 'https://example.com/version.txt'

# Get the current version of the app
try:
    version_file = requests.get(version_url)
    version_file.raise_for_status()
    current_version = float(version_file.text)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print("Error getting current version: ", e)
    current_version = None

# Compare the current version with the version of the app
if current_version and current_version > current_app_version:
    print("A new version is available: {}".format(current_version))
    # Prompt the user to download the new version
    choice = input("Do you want to download the new version now? (y/n)")
    if choice == "y":
        # Download the new version
        download_url = 'https://example.com/app_v{}.exe'.format(current_version)
        try:
            app = requests.get(download_url)
            app.raise_for_status()
            with open("app_v{}.exe".format(current_version), "wb") as f:
                f.write(app.content)
            print("Download complete!")
            os.startfile("app_v{}.exe".format(current_version))
            os._exit(0)
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print("Error downloading new version: ", e)
    else:
        print("You can download the new version later from: {}".format(download_url))




"""
In the above example, the application is checking a remote version file located on a web server,
the version file is just a plain text file containing the version number of the latest version of the application.
When the application starts, it compares the version number in the version file with the version number of the current executable.
If there is a newer version available, it prompts the user to download it. The user can then download the new version, and run it.

You can also use other methods like checking for updates through an API.
This way you can check for updates and notify the user in a more sophisticated way.

Keep in mind that this method requires the user to download the whole executable again,
which might be a bit of a hassle for them, and also it will consume more bandwidth.
