"""
This implementation of the Hill climbing algorithm follows the basic outline of the algorithm: 
it repeatedly generates a list of next possible states, chooses the best one, and moves to that state
if it is better than the current state. The cost function is used to evaluate the quality of a state
and determine which state is the best one. The algorithm terminates either when a maximum number of iterations
is reached or when a satisfactory solution is found.
