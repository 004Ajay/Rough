To construct a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to diagnose heart patients, we can use the standard Heart Disease Data Set.
This data set contains several features that can be used to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not,
such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.

First, we will need to load the data set and split it into training and test sets.
This will allow us to train our SVM on a portion of the data and then evaluate its performance on the remaining data.
Here is an example of how this can be done using the pandas and scikit-learn libraries:
"""

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the data set
df = pd.read_csv('heart_disease.csv')

# Split the data into training and test sets
X = df.drop(columns=['target'])
y = df['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


"""
Next, we can train a SVM on the training data using the SVC class from the scikit-learn library.
This class allows us to specify the type of SVM (e.g., linear, polynomial, or radial basis function) and
the hyperparameters for the model (e.g., the regularization parameter and kernel coefficients).
Here is an example of how this can be done:
"""

from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Train a linear SVM
model = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

"""
Once the SVM is trained, we can evaluate its performance on the test data using the predict method.
This method returns the predicted labels for the test data, which we can then compare to the true labels to compute the model's accuracy.
Here is an example of how this can be done:
"""

# Evaluate the model on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = (y_pred == y_test).mean()
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)


"""
Finally, we can use the trained SVM to diagnose heart patients using their medical data.
This can be done by providing the model with the patient's features as input, and then using
the predict method to obtain the predicted label (i.e., whether the patient has heart disease or not).
Here is an example of how this can be done:
"""

# Diagnose a new patient
patient_data = [65, 1, 0, 170, 256, 0, 1, 1, 1]
patient_data = [patient_data]  # SVM expects a 2D array as input
patient_label = model.predict(patient_data)
print('Predicted label:', patient_label)

"""
Overall, constructing a SVM to diagnose heart patients using the standard Heart Disease Data Set involves the following steps:

1. Load the data set and split it into training and test sets.
2. Train a SVM on the training data.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
4. Use the trained SVM to diagnose heart patients using their medical data.
